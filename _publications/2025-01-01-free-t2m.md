## Abstract

This paper proposes Free-T2M, a frequency enhanced text-to-motion diffusion model that significantly improves the quality and stability of generated motions. By introducing a consistency loss function and enhancing frequency information, our model generates more natural and text-aligned human motions.

## Key Contributions

- **Frequency Enhancement**: Novel approach to enhance frequency information in motion generation
- **Consistency Loss**: Improved training stability through carefully designed consistency loss
- **Superior Performance**: Demonstrates improved motion quality and text-motion alignment
- **Robust Generation**: Enhanced stability in motion generation across diverse text descriptions

## Technical Approach

Our approach combines diffusion models with frequency domain processing and consistency regularization to achieve state-of-the-art text-to-motion generation performance.
