## Abstract

This paper presents RMDM, a physics-informed radio map diffusion model that addresses the challenging task of radio map generation while considering physical constraints and environmental effects. Our approach significantly improves the accuracy and robustness of radio map reconstruction.

## Key Contributions

- **Physics-Informed Design**: Integration of physical constraints into diffusion model architecture
- **Enhanced Accuracy**: Improved radio map reconstruction precision
- **Robust Performance**: Better handling of environmental variations and noise
- **Network Optimization**: Practical applications in 5G-Advanced and 6G networks

## Applications

- Urban network planning and optimization
- Signal coverage prediction
- Wireless communication system design
- Network performance analysis
